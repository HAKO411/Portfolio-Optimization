# Portfolio-Optimization

In this section, we briefly introduce the theories we applied in order to select an optimal portfolio. Modern Portfolio Theory states that by diversifying the portfolio, investors could find the highest expected return with any given level of volatility [1]. With this statement, we could find all the efficient portfolios that lies on the efficient frontier. Sharpe (1994) developed the Sharpe ratio which measures the risk (excess) return rate of the portfolio. Additionally, by combining the risk-free asset and the efficient portfolio that is on the efficient frontier, we could obtain the tangential portfolio where the Sharpe ratio is maximized and provides the best risk return trade off [3]![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61934483/126031937-75d40402-f2cd-4ac1-89cb-616b11506621.png)
